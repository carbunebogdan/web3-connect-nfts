This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[TEST]
```bash
npm run test
```
I only added a few basic Jest tests. I would also do some e2e tests with Synpress(to make sure we have control over MetaMask) - https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress
